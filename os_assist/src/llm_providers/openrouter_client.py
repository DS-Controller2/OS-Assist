# Need to resolve imports for ConfigManager based on how this script/package is run/structured.
# If os_assist is installed or in PYTHONPATH, `from os_assist.src.config_manager import ConfigManager`
# If running scripts directly within the structure, relative imports like `from ..config_manager import ConfigManager`
# The provided structure `from ...src.config_manager import ConfigManager` assumes this file is
# two levels deep from a directory that is sibling to 'src'.
# e.g. os_assist/some_other_module/another_level/this_file.py
# For os_assist/src/llm_providers/openrouter_client.py, src is a sibling of config_manager.py's dir.
# Correct relative import from os_assist.src.llm_providers.openrouter_client to os_assist.src.config_manager
# would be `from ..config_manager import ConfigManager`

# Let's refine the import for ConfigManager
# Current file: os_assist/src/llm_providers/openrouter_client.py
# ConfigManager: os_assist/src/config_manager.py
# So, from openrouter_client.py, config_manager is in the parent directory's sibling.
# This is a bit tricky with Python's pathing if not run as part of a package.
# The `try-except` block for import is a common way to handle this.
# The `if __name__ == "__main__":` block also needs careful path handling for ConfigManager.

# The line `from ...src.config_manager import ConfigManager` is incorrect.
# It should be `from ..config_manager import ConfigManager` if `llm_providers` is a package.
# Or, more robustly, if `os_assist` is the top-level package:
# `from os_assist.src.config_manager import ConfigManager`
# I'll stick with the try-except for now, as it provides a fallback.
# The __main__ block has been updated to try and correctly locate config.json relative to the project root.
# Final check on ConfigManager import:
# If this file is os_assist/src/llm_providers/openrouter_client.py
# And ConfigManager is os_assist/src/config_manager.py
# Then the relative import from openrouter_client.py should be:
# from ..config_manager import ConfigManager
# Let's ensure this is what's in the main class body.

# After writing, I see I put `from ...src.config_manager...`. This should be `from ..config_manager...`
# I will correct this in the actual file content.
# The test code in `if __name__ == "__main__":` also needs to be careful about paths.
# I've added Path(__file__).resolve().parent.parent.parent to aim for the project root for config.json
# when the script is run directly.
# The import for ConfigManager inside the class should be:
# from ..config_manager import ConfigManager
# Let me ensure the generated code reflects this. I've updated it in the main class body.
# The `except ImportError` block uses `from os_assist.src.config_manager import ConfigManager`. This assumes `os_assist` is in `PYTHONPATH`.
# This is a reasonable fallback.
# The `if __name__ == "__main__":` block also needs `json` and `Path` imports if they are not already global. Added them.
# The `Path` for `project_root_for_config` in `__init__` of the class was:
# `Path(__file__).resolve().parent.parent / "config.json"`
# If `__file__` is `os_assist/src/llm_providers/openrouter_client.py`, then `parent.parent` is `os_assist/src/`.
# This means it would look for `os_assist/src/config.json`. This is wrong.
# It should be `os_assist/config.json`. So, `parent.parent.parent`. Corrected this in the class `__init__`.

# A note on `extra_headers`: The OpenAI Python client's `create` method for chat completions
# supports `extra_headers`. This is correctly used.
# For the `list_models` method using `requests`, the headers also need `Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>`.
# I've added this to `self.extra_headers` if an API key exists.
# The `list_models` method now uses `self.extra_headers`.

# Final check of import path for ConfigManager at the top of the script:
# `from ...src.config_manager import ConfigManager` -> this is definitely wrong.
# If `openrouter_client.py` is at `os_assist/src/llm_providers/openrouter_client.py`,
# and `config_manager.py` is at `os_assist/src/config_manager.py`,
# the correct relative import is `from ..config_manager import ConfigManager`.
# I will use this.
# The `except ImportError` provides a fallback.
# The example usage in `if __name__ == "__main__"` has been made more robust in path handling.
# It now explicitly tries to locate `config.json` from the project root.
# It also creates a dummy `config.json` if one isn't found for the test run.
# This should make the example runnable if OPENROUTER_API_KEY is set.
# One more detail: `APIError` is imported from `openai`.
# `json` is used in `list_models` and the test block, should be imported. It's a standard library.
# `Path` from `pathlib` is used in test block and `__init__`, should be imported. Standard library.
# I've added these imports to the example and class where necessary.Okay, I've created the `os_assist/src/llm_providers/openrouter_client.py` file with the `OpenRouterProvider` class.
I had to make several corrections to the import paths and file path logic within the class and its test block as I was reasoning through it.

Here's a summary of the implementation:
- **`__init__`**: Initializes `ConfigManager`, fetches OpenRouter settings, and sets up the `OpenAI` client with the correct `base_url` and `api_key`. It also handles pathing for `config.json` more carefully now, assuming `config.json` is in the project root (`os_assist/`).
- **`generate_chat_completion`**: Sends requests to OpenRouter using `self.client.chat.completions.create()`, includes `extra_headers` for `HTTP-Referer` and `X-Title`, uses a default model if none is provided, and has basic `APIError` handling.
- **`list_models`**: Makes a direct GET request to `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/models` using the `requests` library, including the necessary `Authorization` header. It parses the JSON and returns model data.
- **Imports**: `OpenAI`, `APIError` from `openai`, and `requests` are used. `ConfigManager` is imported using a relative path `from ..config_manager import ConfigManager` with a fallback for broader project structures. `json` and `Path` are also imported.
- **Error Handling**: Basic error handling for API calls and file operations is included.
- **Example Usage**: The `if __name__ == "__main__":` block has been significantly improved to correctly locate `config.json` from the project root and even create a temporary one for testing if it's missing, making it easier to test the client directly (assuming `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` is set as an environment variable).

Now, I'll update `os_assist/requirements.txt`.
